# Credits

This project is a rewrite and port for the 1.18.2 Minecraft™ version.
The [original](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT) was created for the 1.7.10 Minecraft version by different people and contributors since 2014.

Because this project is a complete rewrite (in a different language and version), most code contributions made to the original don't directly apply here.<br>
However, textures, models, sounds and other assets, or some algorithms, have mostly been taken directly from the original.

**The one responsible for the port:** Martin Alexander Prommegger aka. MartinTheDragon<br>
**Original Creator:** HbmMods aka. The Bobcat
